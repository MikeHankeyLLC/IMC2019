                <h2>How to get to Bollmannsruh</h2>

                <div class="alert alert-info">
                       Thursday, 3rd October, is a general holiday in Germany - hence select only trains which are labelled "täglich" (daily) or "Feiertag" (holiday)
                </div>

                <p>From the motorway A2, it takes about half an hour by car to reach Bollmannsruh. There is a large parking
                area in front of the KiEZ grounds. Brandenburg has a train station with trains directly to Berlin Hauptbahnhof
                (main station). The trains are called RE1.</p>
                <p> The two airports of Berlin are called Tegel (TXL) and Schönefeld (SXF). Budget airlines tend to prefer
                Schönefeld as their destination. The new airport of Berlin will not yet be operational in 2019. Tegel connects to
                Berlin main station with a bus, while Schönefeld is connected by a city train (S-Bahn). The RE1 is the relevant
                train also for people arriving by train; coming from northern, eastern and southern Europe, they change to RE1
                in Berlin, while people coming from western Europe may also change to RE1 in Magdeburg. We will arrange for
                cars shuttling to Brandenburg main station on Thursday and Sunday.</p>
                <p>You may consider combining the trip to the IMC with a visit to the nature reserve “Westhavelland” offering
                very dark skies, which you can reach by car in about 45 minutes. The new Moon on September 28 favours the
                nights before the IMC.</p>

                        <? /*
            
            <p><strong>Bratislava</strong>, the country capital, is served by its own <a href="https://www.bts.aero/en/" target="_blank">Bratislava international airport</a> (BTS) with regular flights to 22 destinations mainly in Europe. <a href="http://www.viennaairport.com/en/passengers" target="_blank">Vienna (VIE)</a> or <a href="http://www.budapest-airport.com/" target="_blank">Budapest Ferihegy (BUD)</a> international airports could be used alternatively.  If you want to <a href="https://www.bts.aero/en/parking-and-transport/car-rental/" target="_blank">rent a car</a>, you can do that for a reasonable price at the airport. </p>
            
            <p>At the Bratislava airport, you can take <a href="https://imhd.sk/ba/schedule-timetable/route-line/61" target="_blank">public transportation bus No. 61</a> (or <a href="https://imhd.sk/ba/schedule-timetable/route-line/n61" target="_blank">N61 at night</a>) or a taxi to reach the main bus or train station. You can find a comprehensive map of the Bratislava public transportation <a href="https://imhd.sk/ba/media/mn/00001823/Denne-linky-20171002.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (PDF).</p>
 
            <p><strong><span class="fa fa-taxi"></span> TAXI in Bratislava</strong> - it might be helpful to use taxi for some participants (to get to train station, from the airport etc.). There are lot of possibilities, but we recommend:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://www.greentaxibratislava.sk/cennik" target=_"blank">GreenTaxi</a> (+421 905 660 660, +421 2 16660). This company offers a ride directly from Bratislava to Pezinok for 15€ (slightly more expensive from the airport).</li>
              <li><a href="http://easytaxi.sk/bratislava/" target="_blank">EasyTaxi</a> (+421 918 555 555)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both companies offer quite reasonable prices (5€/ride in Bratislava, 8€ from the airport to the city)</p>

            <p><span class="fa fa-warning"></span> <strong>Some drivers don't accept credit cards!</strong></p>

        <h3>From Vienna</h3>
        <p><strong>From Vienna</strong>, there are several possibilities to use low-cost shuttle busses operating on the daily basis between Vienna and Bratislava. The providers include: <a href="http://www.slovaklines.sk/vienna/to-vienna-schwechat-airport-already-from-eur-1.html" target="_blank">SlovakLines</a>,  <a href="https://www.regiojet.com/" target="_blank">RegioJet</a>, <a href="https://www.flixbus.com/bus-routes/bus-vienna-bratislava?wt_eid=2152457513318975327&amp;wt_t=1524576404790&amp;_ga=2.87222808.1861146659.1524575123-1527028762.1524575123&amp;_gac=1.259195384.1524575123.CjwKCAjwq_vWBRACEiwAEReprJe5af7y4WP3ZUzNaCj_lkVQdF1or5uev_-qD41sOd_-r-EZPTQ4VxoC6rwQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">FlixBus</a>, <a href="http://www.blaguss.sk/pages/en/home.php?lang=EN" target="_blank">Blaguss</a>. You can also take the train from <a href="https://tickets.oebb.at/en/ticket" target="_blank">Vienna Hauptbahnhof</a> to Bratislava Hlavná stanica or main railway station (approx. 1-hour journey). </p>

        <h3>From Budapest</h3>
        <p><strong>From Budapest</strong>,  the best option is to take the  international <a href="http://www.slovakrail.sk/en/ic-trains.html" target="_blank">InterCity/EuroCity train</a> from Keleti station to Bratislava main railway station (approx. 2-hour journey, runs every day).</p>
  
        <h2>How to get from Bratislava to Pezinok</h2>
        <p>Once you get to Bratislava (see section above), there are regular train and bus  connections between Bratislava and Pezinok. You can use:</p>
  
        <p><span class="fa fa-train"></span> <strong>TRAIN</strong> –  departs from <a href="http://www.slovakrail.sk/en/prices-and-discounts/tickets.html" target="_blank">Bratislava main railway station</a> (Bratislava hlavná stanica, usually abbreviated as Bratislava hl.st.) towards Pezinok approx. every 30 minutes.  It takes no more than 20 minutes to get to Pezinok. We recommend to take the train since the bus station is under reconstruction (see below)</p>

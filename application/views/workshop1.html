                Right before the IMC, a Visual Workshop will be organized at the conference venue. The
                Workshop will focus on a hands-on session where experts share their experience in a global
                analysis of the visual observations of the Perseids 2016, using the Visual Meteor Database and
                the MetFns analysis software. With this software having been updated recently, we feel the
                timing for such a workshop is just right. We hope it will contribute to helping meteor workers to
                get the most out of the IMO’s visual (and other) meteor data, e.g., by performing global analysis
                of meteor showers themselves.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Practical information and program</h3><p><strong>The Visual Workshop will start at <a href="/workshop1_day1">14:00 on Wednesday, August 29<sup>th</sup></a>, and end

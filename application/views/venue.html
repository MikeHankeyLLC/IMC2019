       <p>The 38th International Meteor Conference (IMC)
        will be held in Bollmannsruh, Germany, a countryside place not far from Berlin. The venue is
        a youth hostel by a lake, which hosted the IMC
        already in 2003.</p>
        <p>The hostel is called <a href="https://kiez-bollmannsruh.de/" target="_blank">KiEZ Boll-mannsruh</a> and can as such be found on Google
        maps. Alternatively, the address is Bollmanns-ruh 13, 14778 PÃ¤wesin, Germany, or it can be
        found at the geographical coordinates 52.506 N, 12.679 E. </p>
        <p>
        We were able to rent the entire place
        for October 3-6. Earlier dates were not available
        in 2019. The hostel offers accomodation in bun-galows, a conference hall as well as a few smaller
        semimar rooms. Note that the relatively remote
        location brings along rather poor connectivity to
        the internet.</p> 

<p>The area is
a 25-acre place for recreation with surrounding
forests and fields for extensive hikes. For the
brave, swimming in the lake is possible, but water temperatures will have dropped to about 
15&deg; C by October.</p>
